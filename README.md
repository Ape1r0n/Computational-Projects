# Computational Projects

This repository contains 8 computational projects (CPs) assigned during three courses:

1. Numerical Linear Algebra (NLA)
2. Numerical Analysis (NA)
3. Numerical Programming (NP)

Six of these projects were assigned during the lecture period, with 2 projects for each subject, while the last 2 projects were final exam projects for NP. Unfortunately, the CPs for Numerical Linear Algebra do not have documentation, but the rest do (note that NA CP 1 is only the documentation).
All of these computational projects were graded with maximum points, except for NP CP 2, which lacked tests of different ODE solvers (although this was not a requirement) and was only tested with RK4.

## NLA Computational Projects

1. **Hill Cipher with Finite Digit Arithmetic 🤐**: Implemented finite digit arithmetic and solved linear systems using direct or iterative methods.
2. **Least Squares and Constrained Least Squares 📈**: Used QR Factorization (Pseudo-Inverse calculation) and Classical/Modified Gram-Schmidt for stock prediction.

## NA Computational Projects

1. **Edge Detection and Derivatives 🔍**: Explored edge detection techniques and derivatives.
2. **Interpolation and Image Restoration 🎨**: Consists of two problems:
	* a. **Interpolation Methods 📊**: Used three interpolation methods to approximate sound waves.
	* b. **Radial Basis Functions 📈**: Used three different radial basis functions for restoring digital images.

## NP Computational Projects

1. **Edge Detection + Clustering 📹**: Detected objects and their speed from a video using edge detection and clustering techniques.
2. **Ball Motion ODEs 🏀**: Extracted coefficients of ball motion ODEs.

### NP Final Exam Projects

1. **Hit a Ball to a Fixed Target 🎯**: Given an image with only balls and a solid background, chose an initial position and shot all the balls using ball motion ODEs.
2. **Intercept a Moving Ball 🚀**: Predicted the path of a ball that satisfies ball motion ODEs and intercepted it with a ball that also uses ball motion ODEs.
